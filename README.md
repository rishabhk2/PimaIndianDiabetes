    "A perceptron is a densely connected neural network. Perceptron is a type of implementation for Linear Classification, here we will be using perceptron algorithm for binary linear classification. We will be implementing a single layer perceptron. It is always a good practice to visualize the data so we visualized the raw data. We visualized the data using many functions like plotting histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix and after getting the feel of the data we started playing with the perceptron algorithm. We will be following the common workflow of Machine Learning. We divided the data into three parts that is Training, Validation and Testing. As this is a linear model, so we will be using the equation of straight line, which is y=mx+c. We will be using some formulas with which we will be updating weights, calculating loss values,getting prediction ,accuracy. We will also store the best weights after our 'n'epochs, in this case of study we used 20 epochs, and we will use these best weights on the testing dataset and after doing that we get an accuracy of 74.29\\%.After that we consider perceptron from sklearn library and see that our accuracy was 69.26\\%."
